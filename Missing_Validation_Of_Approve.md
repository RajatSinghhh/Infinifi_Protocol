# Summary

Missing return value checks for `approve` calls across critical functions.

# Finding Description

The contract `InfinifiGatewayV1.sol` is missing return value checks for the `approve` method in multiple functions.
Specifically, the following functions call `approve` without verifying its result:

- `mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)`
- `mintAndStake(address _to, uint256 _amount)`
- `mintAndLock(address _to, uint256 _amount, uint32 _unwindingEpochs)`
- and all other locations where `approve` is used.

According to the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation, the `approve` method returns a boolean value indicating success (`true`) or failure (`false`).
Currently, the code does not check this return value.
If an `approve` call were to fail (return `false`), the function would continue executing, potentially leading to serious issues within the protocol such as unauthorized minting of tokens or other unexpected behaviors.

# Impact Explanation

The impact is `medium`, as failure to detect a failed `approve` can result in unauthorized minting of tokens or incorrectly configured token allowances, which could compromise the protocol's integrity.

# Likelihood Explanation

The likelihood is `high`, because the affected functions (minting, staking, locking) are core user entry points and are frequently called during normal user interactions with the protocol.

# Proof of Concept

The screenshots below demonstrate locations where `approve` is used without return value checks:

**Mint Function**
**Mint and Lock Approve**
**Mint and Stake Approve**

# Recommendation

It is strongly recommended to replace all direct calls to `approve` with `safeApprove` from OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library.
The `safeApprove` method automatically reverts the transaction if the underlying `approve` returns `false`, ensuring the system remains in a consistent and secure state.

**Example fix:**

```diff
- usdc.approve(address(mintController), _amount);
+ usdc.safeApprove(address(mintController), _amount);
```
